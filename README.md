## Structure

Single static HTML file — no build step, no framework, no dependencies. CSS is inlined to keep the repo as simple as possible.

The visual style mirrors [insight.ale-saglia.com](https://insight.ale-saglia.com) — same typeface (Georgia), same colour palette, same layout width — so navigation between the two feels continuous.

## Deployment

Deployed via GitHub Pages from the `main` branch. The custom domain `ale-saglia.com` is configured via a `CNAME` file in the repo root and four `A` records pointing to GitHub's servers on Cloudflare DNS. Any push to `main` triggers a new deploy automatically. No build step required — GitHub Pages serves `index.html` directly.
